# Client Document Monitoring System — Documentation

**Script:** `Code-Client-Document-Management.gs`  
**Manifest:** `appscript.json`  
**Type:** Google Apps Script (Bound to a Google Spreadsheet)  
**Authored by:** Atty. Mary Wendy Duran  
**Last Modified:** 21 September 2025

## Overview

This is a **Google Apps Script automation system** bound to a Google Spreadsheet. It monitors two Google Drive folders used by a law firm (Duran Schulze) for legal case management:

1. **"01 Client Documents"** — Files uploaded by clients
2. **"5.02 Scanned Pleadings"** — Scanned legal pleadings filed by or against the firm

The system automatically:
- Detects new, modified, moved, or deleted files in both drives
- Tracks **who uploaded or modified** each file (by email)
- **AI-renames pleading files** using Gemini into a clean `YYYY-MM-DD Descriptive Title` format
- Logs all activity to a dedicated Logs sheet
- Runs on a **daily schedule** (6 PM Manila time, Mon–Fri)

## Function Reference

### Setup & Initialization

#### `setupSystem()`
Creates all required sheets if they don't exist, initializes all config keys in the hidden `System Config` sheet, and shows a setup summary alert.

#### `createClientDocsSheet(spreadsheet)`
Creates the `Uploaded By Client` sheet with headers, frozen row, blue header formatting, and column widths.

#### `createPleadingsSheet(spreadsheet)`
Creates the `Summary of Pleadings` sheet with headers, formatting, and calls `setupPleadingsDropdowns()`.

#### `createSheet(spreadsheet, name, headers, hidden)`
Generic sheet creator used for Annexes, Checklist, Hearing Dates, Entries, Logs, and System Config.

#### `setupPleadingsDropdowns(sheet)`
Applies data validation dropdowns to columns D (Filed/Issued By), G (Action Needed), and H (Assigned DDS Party) for rows 2–1000.

---

### Drive Configuration

#### `setClientDocumentsDriveId()`
Prompts the user to enter a Google Drive folder ID. Validates access via `DriveApp.getFolderById()`, then saves to `System Config` as `CLIENT_DOCUMENTS_DRIVE_ID`.

#### `setScannedPleadingsDriveId()`
Same as above but saves as `SCANNED_PLEADINGS_DRIVE_ID`.

---

### AI / Gemini Functions

#### `generateAiPleadingTitle(fileName)` *(new — fixed)*
The **core AI function**. Given a raw filename, calls the Gemini REST API to generate a clean, formal legal title in proper title case.

- Reads the API key from User Properties (`GEMINI_API_KEY`)
- If no key is set, returns `null` immediately (graceful fallback)
- Sends a structured prompt to `gemini-2.0-flash` with `temperature: 0.2` and `maxOutputTokens: 150`
- Returns the AI-generated title string, or `null` on any error
- All errors are logged to console (non-fatal)

**Prompt used:**
> "You are a legal document classifier. Given the raw filename of a scanned legal pleading, produce a clean, formal, human-readable descriptive title (no date prefix, no file extension). Use proper title case. Output ONLY the title, nothing else."

#### `setGeminiApiKey()`
Prompts the user for their Gemini API key, calls `testGeminiApiKey()` to validate it, then stores it in `PropertiesService.getUserProperties()` under key `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

#### `testGeminiApiKey(apiKey)`
Sends a minimal test prompt (`"Say 'API key test successful' in exactly those words."`) to the Gemini endpoint. Throws an error if the HTTP response is not 200 or if the response structure is invalid.

#### `clearGeminiApiKey()`
Deletes the stored `GEMINI_API_KEY` from User Properties after confirmation.

---

### File Naming

#### `generatePleadingName(originalName, dateCreated)`
Generates the final display/Drive name for a pleading file.

**Logic:**
1. Formats the date as `YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Calls `generateAiPleadingTitle(originalName)` — if AI returns a title, uses it
3. If AI is unavailable or fails, falls back to cleaning up the original filename:
   - Removes file extension
   - Replaces `_` and `-` with spaces
   - Title-cases each word
4. Returns: `YYYY-MM-DD <Title>.<extension>`

**Example:**
- Input: `motion_to_dismiss_2024.pdf`, date `2024-03-15`
- AI output: `"Motion to Dismiss"`
- Final name: `2024-03-15 Motion to Dismiss.pdf`

---

### Scanning

#### `scanSharedDriveEnhanced(driveId, driveType, isFullScan, sheetName)`
Recursively scans all files in a Drive folder and its subfolders.

- Skips system/temp files via `isSystemOrTempFile()`
- Calls `getFileInfoEnhanced()` for each file
- On full scan: clears the sheet and calls `addFileToClientDocsSheet()` or `addFileToPleadingsSheet()` for each file
- Returns a `fileIndex` object keyed by file ID
- Throttles every 10 files with a 100ms sleep

#### `detectChangesEnhanced(driveId, driveType, sheetName, indexKey)`
Compares the current Drive state against the stored file index to detect:
- **NEW** files → adds to sheet (and renames pleadings)
- **USER_MODIFIED** files → logs the modification
- **NAME_UPDATED** files → renames existing pleading files in Drive and updates the sheet hyperlink

Saves the updated index back to `System Config`.

#### `manualFullScanClientDocs()` / `manualFullScanPleadings()`
Wrappers that call `manualFullScan()` with the correct config keys for each drive type.

#### `manualFullScan(configKey, driveType, displayName, sheetName, indexKey, lastScanKey)`
Shows a confirmation dialog, runs `scanSharedDriveEnhanced()` in full-scan mode, saves the updated index and timestamp, and shows a completion summary.

#### `scanBothDrives()`
Runs full scans on both drives sequentially after a single confirmation dialog.

#### `scheduledScan()`
The function called by the daily time-based trigger. Skips weekends. Calls `detectChangesEnhanced()` for both drives (only if they have been previously full-scanned).

---

### File Sheet Operations

#### `addFileToClientDocsSheet(fileInfo, remarks)`
Appends a row to `Uploaded By Client` with a `HYPERLINK` formula for the file name, upload/modification emails, and timestamps.

#### `addFileToPleadingsSheet(fileInfo)`
Appends a row to `Summary of Pleadings`. Before appending:
1. Calls `generatePleadingName()` to get the AI-renamed title
2. Renames the actual Drive file via `DriveApp.getFileById().setName()`
3. Auto-detects default values for Filed/Issued By and Action Needed based on filename keywords
4. Special case: `judgment`/`decision` files default to `"No Action Needed"` and `"Completed"`

#### `updateExistingPleadingName(sheet, rowIndex, newName, fileId)`
Updates the hyperlink formula in an existing pleadings row to reflect a renamed file.

#### `findExistingRowByFileId(sheet, fileId)`
Searches the pleadings sheet for a row whose hyperlink URL contains the given file ID. Returns `{ rowIndex, data }` or `null`.

---

### User Tracking

#### `getFileInfoEnhanced(file, folderPath, driveType, rootFolderName)`
Builds a `fileInfo` object for a Drive file, including calling `getEnhancedUserInfo()` to populate `uploadedByEmail` and `lastModifiedByEmail`.

#### `getEnhancedUserInfo(file)`
Attempts to extract uploader and last-modifier emails using three methods in order:

1. **Advanced Drive API** (`Drive.Files.get()` with `owners` and `lastModifyingUser` fields) — most accurate
2. **Standard DriveApp** (`file.getOwners()`) — fallback
3. **Domain inference** — checks if filename contains the firm domain as a last resort

Returns `{ uploadedByEmail, lastModifiedByEmail, fromAdvancedApi }`.

---

### Scheduling

#### `setupDailySchedule()`
Deletes any existing `scheduledScan` triggers, then creates a new time-based trigger: daily at `CONFIG.SCHEDULE_HOUR` (18:00) in `Asia/Manila` timezone.

#### `removeDailySchedule()`
Finds and deletes all triggers whose handler function is `scheduledScan`.

---

### Diagnostics

#### `testClientDocsAccess()` / `testPleadingsAccess()`
Calls `testDriveAccess()` for the respective drive.

#### `testDriveAccess(configKey, driveType, displayName)`
Opens the configured folder, counts up to 5 files, and shows an access report.

#### `testUserTracking()`
Calls `testDriveUserTracking()` for each configured drive and shows a summary of how many files had successful email extraction and whether the Advanced Drive API is working.

#### `testDriveUserTracking(driveId, driveName)`
Tests `getEnhancedUserInfo()` on up to 3 files in the given folder.

#### `viewSystemStatus()`
Shows a full status alert including: Drive IDs configured, last scan timestamps, Gemini API key presence, trigger status, and feature flags.

---

### Utility Functions

#### `logEvent(eventType, driveType, fileId, fileName, userEmail, details, status, errorMessage)`
Appends a row to the `Logs` sheet. Automatically trims the log to the most recent 1000 entries.

#### `getConfigValue(key)` / `setConfigValue(key, value)`
Read/write key-value pairs in the hidden `System Config` sheet.

#### `retryDriveOperation(operation, maxRetries)`
Wraps any Drive API call with retry logic (up to `CONFIG.MAX_RETRIES` attempts, with exponential-ish delay).

#### `isSystemOrTempFile(fileName)`
Returns `true` for temp/system files: `~$*`, `.tmp`, `.crdownload`, `.part`, `desktop.ini`, `thumbs.db`, `.DS_Store`, LibreOffice lock files.

#### `detectPleadingType(fileName)`
Matches the filename against `PLEADING_TYPES` regex patterns and returns the type string (e.g., `"Motion"`, `"Order"`, `"Affidavit"`). Defaults to `"Document"`.

#### `getExistingFileData(sheet, driveType)`
Reads all rows from a tracking sheet and returns a map of `{ displayName → { rowIndex, data } }` by parsing the `HYPERLINK` formula in the File Name column.

#### `updateActionNeededDropdown()`
Standalone function to re-apply the Action Needed dropdown validation to `G2:G100` of the `Summary of Pleadings` sheet. Useful for fixing validation on existing sheets without running a full setup.

#### `testSheetAccess()`
Simple diagnostic: checks if the `Summary of Pleadings` sheet exists and shows an alert.

## `appscript.json` Manifest

```json
{
  "timeZone": "Asia/Manila",
  "dependencies": {
    "enabledAdvancedServices": [
      { "userSymbol": "Drive", "serviceId": "drive", "version": "v2" }
    ]
  },
  "oauthScopes": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request"
  ],
  "exceptionLogging": "STACKDRIVER",
  "runtimeVersion": "V8"
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `timeZone` | Sets script timezone to Manila (UTC+8) |
| `enabledAdvancedServices` | Enables the **Advanced Drive API v2** required for `Drive.Files.get()` (owner/modifier email extraction) |
| `oauthScopes` | Declares all required permissions: Sheets, Drive read/write, Drive metadata, and external HTTP requests (for Gemini API calls) |
| `exceptionLogging` | Sends unhandled errors to Google Cloud Stackdriver |
| `runtimeVersion` | Uses V8 JavaScript engine (supports modern JS syntax) |

> **Critical:** The `enabledAdvancedServices` entry must also be enabled in the Google Cloud Console for the Apps Script project under **APIs & Services → Enable APIs → Google Drive API**.

---

## Bugs Fixed

| # | Location | Bug | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `appscript.json` | `dependencies` was empty `{}` — Advanced Drive API not declared, causing `Drive.Files.get()` to throw `ReferenceError: Drive is not defined` | Added `enabledAdvancedServices` with Drive API v2 |
| 2 | `appscript.json` | `oauthScopes` missing — Gemini API calls (`script.external_request`) and Drive metadata access not authorized | Added full `oauthScopes` array |
| 3 | `GEMINI_CONFIG.MODEL_ENDPOINT` | Used deprecated `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model endpoint | Updated to stable `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| 4 | `createClientDocsSheet()` line ~857 | `setFrontColor("white")` — typo, not a valid Spreadsheet method, silently fails leaving header text invisible | Fixed to `setFontColor("white")` |
| 5 | `testGeminiApiKey()` | `generationConfig` did not pass `maxOutputTokens` — `MAX_TOKENS` constant was defined but never used in any API call | Added `maxOutputTokens: GEMINI_CONFIG.MAX_TOKENS` |
| 6 | `generatePleadingName()` | AI was configured (Gemini key, endpoint, config) but `generateAiPleadingTitle()` was never implemented — the renaming was purely regex-based despite the header claiming "AI-powered" | Implemented `generateAiPleadingTitle()` and wired it into `generatePleadingName()` with filename-based fallback |
